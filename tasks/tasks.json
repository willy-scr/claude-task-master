Refactor the content to make it Windsurf-specific, replacing Cursor-specific terminology and adapting guidelines as needed\n4. Create a function that generates a .windsurfrules document from this content\n5. Integrate this function into the initialization pipeline\n6. Implement logic to check if a .windsurfrules document already exists:\n   - If it exists, append the new content to it\n   - If it doesn't exist, create a new document\n7. Ensure proper error handling for file operations\n8. Add appropriate logging to track the generation and modification of the .windsurfrules document\n\nThe implementation should be modular and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between content extraction, refactoring, and file operations.",
      "testStrategy": "Testing should verify both the content generation and the integration with the initialization pipeline:\n\n1. Unit Tests:\n   - Test the content extraction function with mock .mdc files\n   - Test the content refactoring function to ensure Cursor-specific terms are properly replaced\n   - Test the file operation functions with mock filesystem\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Test the creation of a new .windsurfrules document when none exists\n   - Test appending to an existing .windsurfrules document\n   - Test the complete initialization pipeline with the new functionality\n\n3. Manual Verification:\n   - Inspect the generated .windsurfrules document to ensure content is properly combined and refactored\n   - Verify that Cursor-specific terminology has been replaced with Windsurf-specific terminology\n   - Run the initialization process multiple times to verify idempotence (content isn't duplicated on multiple runs)\n\n4. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with missing or corrupted .mdc files\n   - Test with an existing but empty .windsurfrules document\n   - Test with an existing .windsurfrules document that already contains some of the content"
